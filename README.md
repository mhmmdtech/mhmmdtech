### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mohammad, a web developer who tries to become a software engineer. For the most part, I'm a PHP developer and Laravel artisan, but I also dabble in some JavaScript and React.JS development too.

I enjoy taking on complex projects that push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible with PHP/Laravel and try to look at things from a different angle, and I welcome opportunities to learn and be exposed to new ideas and experiences. 

Sometimes I try to write about technology and software development in my spare time, and I like to communicate with people and discuss different areas like technology, business, etc.

If you are interested in working with me or learning more about my skills and portfolio, please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn or Email. I would love to hear from you!
